# Platform

The Graphcool platform is a backend-as-a-service that takes full advantage of the power of GraphQL.

## Explore the platform

* You can create your project's data schema and define different settings like permissions or mutation callbacks in the [console](!alias-uh8shohxie).
* The GraphQL type system allows you to precisely define the shape of your [data schema](!alias-ahwoh2fohj) by using models and relations between them.
* For secure data access, you can use the built-in [authentication system](!alias-wejileech9) that uses temporary or permanent authentication tokens to determine the access level of a given request.
* If you want to upload and download files in your project, you can use the built-in [file management system](!alias-eer4wiang0).

## Explore the GraphQL API

Two different client APIs are available:

* The [Relay API](!alias-aizoong9ah) is meant to be used in Facebook's GraphQL client Relay and is conforming to the Relay specification.
* The [Simple API](!alias-heshoov3ai) offers the same features and is meant to be used by Meteor's GraphQL client Apollo or lokka or even plain HTTP.

You can use both APIs at the same time.

A separate GraphQL [file API](!alias-eer4wiang0) is available, but you can also work with files using one of [the client APIs](!alias-heshoov3ai).
