# Schema Editor

The **Schema Editor** allows you to work with your project's [data schema]() and evolve it using [schema migrations](). You can either use the left side to change your schema on a textual basis or use the right side to change your schema with the UI.

An integration with [graphql-voyager]() is available with the Graph View button. You can use it to explore your schema visually.

> More information about elements in the schema file can be found in the [schema]() chapter while changes to the schema are described in the [schema migrations]() chapter.
