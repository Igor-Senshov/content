# Console

The [Graphcool Console](http://console.graph.cool) provides a wide range of possibilities to manage your GraphQL projects. Apart from [different project settings](), many powerful features are available:

* The [Schema Editor]() gives you an overview of your GraphQL schema and allows you to do [schema migrations]() either visually or on a textual basis.

* In the [Data Browser] you can view the stored data for the different [types]() in your GraphQL backend and modify or create new data*

* In the [Permission View]() you can view and modify [permissions]() for operations based on [types]() and [relations]() in your schema

* The Integrations View allows you to enable or disable the available [integrations]() and configure their credentials.

* The [Functions View]() gives an overview over existing [functions](), including most recent invocations and a detailed execution log

* In the [playground](!alias-oe1ier4iej), you can explore and execute all GraphQL queries, mutations and subscriptions available in your [GraphQL API]().
