# Graphcool CLI

You can use the Graphcool CLI to manage your Graphcool projects and run schema migrations.

## Getting Started

* Install the `graphcool` command-line tool:

```sh
npm install -g graphcool
graphcool auth
```

* Create a new project:

```sh
graphcool init
```

This creates a new Graphcool project and a corresponding [project configuration file](!alias-ow2yei7mew).
