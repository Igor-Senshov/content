# How can I be notified about your progress in the product?
## Console
 - **20.03.17**: For some people in the Permissions Popup it was not clear what we mean by "Apply to whole Model". We added a tooltip to
 the button to explain what it's about.
 - **20.03.17**: Even when you didn't have changes, in the databrowser we asked if you really want to leave. This is fixed and we only ask
 you if there are real changes.
 - **20.03.17**: Fixed the links in the Onboarding for Learn Apollo & Learn Relay
 - **20.03.17**: We had the problem in the playground, that the docs didn't fully expand. Many of you have reported this, which we're
 really thankful for. It's now fixed and even on a small screen you can expand the docs much wider.
 - **20.03.17**: Launch of the new Schema View. You now have a better overview over your schema through the GraphQL IDL view and an awesome
 tool called GraphQL Voyager, which we've now included in the Graphcool Console for you.
 - **28.02.17**: Launch of our new subscriptions. Not only have we iterated over the subscription API to make it as powerful and easy
 to use as possible, but also created a unique debugging experience for your GraphQL Subscriptions in the new playground. Give it a try!
