# Changelog

## Week 9
### Console
 - **02/28/17**: Launch of our new subscriptions. Not only have we iterated over the subscription API to make it as powerful and easy
 to use as possible, but also created a unique debugging experience for your GraphQL Subscriptions in the new playground. Give it a try!

## Week 10
### Console
 - In this week there was a lot of progress regarding the Schema View, which will be released next week.
 - Also now the Console has Service Workers which cache all assets so the whole Console loads faster.
 - Minor Bugs like the behavior of the String Cell in the Databrowser have been fixed. (closes
 [#703](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/703),
 [#715](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/715),
 [#734](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/734),
 [#741](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/741),
 [#744](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/744))
 
## Week 11
### Console
 - **03/19/17**: Launch of the new Schema View. You now have a better overview over your schema through the GraphQL IDL view and an awesome
 tool called GraphQL Voyager, which we've now included in the Graphcool Console for you.

## Week 12
### Console
 - **03/20/17**: For some people in the *Permissions Popup* it was not clear what we mean by "Apply to whole Model". There now is a tooltip to the button to explain what it's about. (closes [#536](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/536))
 - **03/20/17**: Even when you didn't have changes, the databrowser asked if you really want to leave. This is fixed and now only
 real changes trigger this popup. (closes [#509](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/509))
 - **03/20/17**: Fixed the links in the Onboarding for Learn Apollo & Learn Relay (closes [#756](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/756))
 - **03/20/17**: The playground had the problem, that the docs didn't fully expand. Many of you have reported this, which we're
 really thankful for. It's now fixed and even on a small screen you can expand the docs much wider. (closes [#758](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/758), [#695](https://github.com/graphcool/console/issues/695))
